> To whom it may concern  
> My name is Nuno Gon√ßalves, and I am Tenured Assistant Professor of the
> University of Coimbra (Portugal), at the Department of Electrical and
> Computers Engineering, Senior Researcher of the Institute of Systems
> and Robotics ‚Äì Coimbra at the Computer Vision Lab and Innovation
> Manager at the Portuguese Mint and Official Printing Office.  
>
> I concluded my PhD in 2008, and my research interests include Computer
> Vision and Artificial Intelligence, mainly related to biometrics, face
> imaging, authentication, secure Facial Recognition Systems,
> printer-proof steganography, geometry, robotics, computer graphics,
> medical imaging, plenoptic cameras, augmented reality, and also other
> fields.  
>
> Jo√£o Tremo√ßo joined my group in September 2020 to develop the work
> that conducted him to the Master‚Äôs degree, in October 2021. Jo√£o
> worked on the important problem of improving the performance of facial
> recognition algorithms based on the quality of portraits for ID and
> travel documents.  
>
> Jo√£o did an outstanding research work, creating new algorithms and a
> quality-driven approach to the problem. His work was published in a
> small, yet very important conference of the topic ‚Äì BIOSIG. Jo√£o was
> always a dedicated student working very hard and with an extremely
> focused working method, which is rare in Master students.  
>
> During his studies, Jo√£o Tremo√ßo has always demonstrated high
> abilities to understand the mathematical complexity of the models
> involved in the research and to manipulate the fundamentals of the
> Deep Learning and Biometrics, while these concepts are no easy to
> understand due to their intrinsic abstract and technical nature. He
> has also demonstrated strong abilities in programming these concepts,
> searching for a trade-off solution and the associated algorithms to
> make them work and be effective.  
>
> More recently, I have been working with Jo√£o Tremo√ßo, in a
> collaboration between my research group and the company where Jo√£o
> currently works, to the creation and dynamization of the Adversarial
> Attack Challenge to be held at the International Joint Conference on
> Biometrics, in Osaka, Japan, in September 2025. Almost 4 years have
> passed, and I noticed that Jo√£o has considerably evolved as
> professional, still doing upfront Research and truly with enthusiasm
> about his work and new challenges.  
>
> From the exposed above, I believe that Jo√£o Tremo√ßo is a very strong
> candidate to work in industry and research in several topics.
