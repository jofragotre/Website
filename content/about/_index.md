## 👋 Hi I'm João! 

I’m a Senior AI Researcher focused on **Computer Vision** and **Biometrics**. Over the last four years I’ve worked across identity verification and secure face recognition: shipping production systems and publishing applied research. The main areas I’ve tackled: face image attack detection (presentation, deepfake, morphing, adversarial) and core pipeline pieces like ICAO-compliant face image quality and face recognition.

I really enjoy the intersection of research and product: taking ideas from paper → prototype → robust production systems. Working on a start-up helps me participate in the entire pipeline. 

If you want to learn more about my professional side you can find information on some of my [side-projects](/projects/), my research [publications](/publications/) and my [credentials](/cv/) - which include curriculum, references and transcripts!

## Personal side

While I introduce myself as João, all my friend call me by my last name "Tremoço". In Portuguese this means lupine, which is a small legume very common in Portugal to accompany a beer!

  />

> So João likes computer vision and biometrics, but what does Tremoço like? 

In summary, lots of different things: 

- 📺 For entertainment I'm an avid follower of **motorsports**, namely F1 and MotoGP but also  **football** - Sporting fan;
- ⚽️ On the sports side play **football** and **padel** but with what it feels like two left feet and two hands (I'm right handed).
- 📸 Lately I've been into **photography** and the results can be seen in the following section!
- 📋 Some other interests include cooking, video-gaming, watches and music. 

These are all great forms of entertainment for me however my most favourite thing todo, although I can't call it an hobbie, is to **travel**.
